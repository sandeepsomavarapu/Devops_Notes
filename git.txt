Here is a basic overview of how Git works:

    Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)
    Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine
    Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes
    "Push" your changes to your main branch
    Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit
    "Pull" the changes to your local machine
    Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change
    Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)
    "Merge" your branch to the main branch
